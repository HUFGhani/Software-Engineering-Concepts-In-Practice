A test oracle is (typically) a program that gives you the desired expected outcome for a test input. Being a program, obviously a test oracle could have bugs and thus give us faulty tests, so oracles typically must be handled with care and suspicion.

In this case, the oracle's behaviour just is the correct behaviour, because we?re trying to exactly reimplement the oracle?s behaviour.

In other cases, we might have implemented a much simpler version of the program we want to test which is more likely to be correct, but lacks other useful features (such as high performance, robustness, or some features).

The extreme version of this is to have a set of programs, all independently implemented, and use majority agreement on output to be the oracle. This is known as N-version programming.
